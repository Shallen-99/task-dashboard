I build applications and mini projects tied to my various interests. I look for creative solutions to real world problems and think of technical ways to address them. While no application is ever perfect I find joy in the process and all my final products!

## Reflection: 
Building this Task Management Dashboard reinforced key React and TypeScript principles, including component modularity, strong typing, and efficient state
management. The challenges encountered, particularly around TypeScript module resolution, performance optimization, and unique ID management, strengthened
my problem-solving skills and highlighted best practices for building scalable, maintainable React applications.
